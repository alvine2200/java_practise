Mid-level Java interviews often include array-related questions that test your problem-solving skills, understanding of algorithms, and knowledge of Java-specific features. Here are some common array-related questions along with the concepts they typically target:

1. Basic Array Manipulations
Reverse an array: Write a program to reverse an array in place.
Find the sum of array elements: Sum all elements in an array.
Find the largest and smallest element: Determine the largest and smallest numbers in an array.
2. Search and Sort
Linear search: Find if a given number exists in the array.
Binary search: Search for an element in a sorted array.
Sorting algorithms: Implement bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort.
3. Rotations and Rearrangements
Rotate an array: Rotate the elements of an array by k positions (left or right).
Rearrange array alternately: Given a sorted array, rearrange it in a max-min order.
Reorder an array based on indices: Reorder elements in an array based on given indices.
4. Frequency and Counting
Count occurrences: Count the frequency of each element in an array.
Find duplicates: Identify duplicate elements in an array.
Find missing numbers: For a sequence of integers, find the missing numbers.
5. Two-Pointer and Sliding Window Techniques
Pair with a given sum: Find all pairs in an array whose sum is equal to a target.
Subarray with a given sum: Find a continuous subarray that adds up to a given number.
Longest subarray with distinct elements: Find the length of the longest subarray containing unique elements.
6. Matrix Manipulation (2D Arrays)
Transpose a matrix: Swap rows with columns.
Rotate a matrix: Rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.
Find the maximum sum sub-matrix: Identify the sub-matrix with the largest sum.
7. Dynamic Programming and Recursion with Arrays
Maximum subarray sum (Kadane's Algorithm): Find the largest sum of any contiguous subarray.
Climbing stairs: Solve problems like Fibonacci using arrays.
Subset sum: Determine if a subset of the array adds up to a given sum.
8. Special Patterns and Challenges
Move zeros: Move all zeros in the array to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.
Find the median: Find the median of two sorted arrays.
Product of all elements except self: Without using division, find a new array where each element is the product of all other elements.
9. Data Structure Conversion
Convert to ArrayList: Convert an array to a List using Arrays.asList().
Convert to a stream: Use Java 8 Streams to manipulate or filter arrays.
Sort using a comparator: Sort an array of objects or primitive types with a custom comparator.
10. Miscellaneous Problems
Check if an array is a palindrome: Verify if the array reads the same backward as forward.
Find equilibrium index: Find an index such that the sum of elements to the left equals the sum to the right.
Find leaders in an array: An element is a leader if all elements to its right are smaller.
Example Mid-Level Questions:
Write a program to rotate an array by k positions without using an additional array.
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
How would you merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array?
Check if two arrays are permutations of each other.
Find the first non-repeating element in an array.
